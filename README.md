The system uses a sensor to measure the oven temperature, while a power driver proportionally controls the AC voltage, adjusting the heating power. The temperature is displayed on a TFT screen, and the entire process is monitored via MQTT, allowing for time and temperature recording, as well as remote control of the oven's power and status.
